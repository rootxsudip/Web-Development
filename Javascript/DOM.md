# DOM

### What is DOM?

â†’ DOM is a document object model. It is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats XML and HTML documents as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

The window object is at the top of the hierarchy. The second one is the document object. The HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The third one is the forms. Everything enclosed in the \<form>...\</form> tags sets the form object.

### **DOM Properties:-**

With the Document Object Model (DOM), we can create and build documents, add, modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML document can be accessed, changed, deleted, or added using the Document Object Model, with a few exceptions. 

The syntax for accessing the DOM properties is: **document.property_name**
