# Arrow Functions

**What is a function?**

→ A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in the program. This eliminates the need to rewrite the same code. The function declaration is a named function written with the function keyword.

Here is an example of a multiply function that returns the product of two parameters:

```jsx
function mul(a, b) {
return a * b
}//calling function
mul(3,3) //returns 9
```

### What are Arrow Functions?

One of the most famous features in modern JavaScript is the arrow function.ES6 arrow functions provide us an alternative way to write a more concise and shorter syntax compared to the traditional function expression. Here is the syntax of arrow functions:

let myfunc = (arg1, arg2, ...argN) => expression

Another example of traditional JS function →

```jsx
let addition = function(x,y) {
 return x + y;
}
console.log(addition(10,10)); // returns 20
```

Now let's see an example of arrow function which is equivalent to the above addition() function expression:

```jsx
let addition = (x,y) => x+y;
console.log(addition(10,10)); //This returns 20
```

### Summary:-

Arrow functions are handy for one-liners. They come in two flavors:

1. Without curly braces: (...args) => expression, where at the right side is an expression. The function evaluates the expression and returns the result.
2. With curly braces: (...args) => { body }, the brackets allow us to write multiple statements inside the function but in such a scenario, we need an explicit return to return something.
