# What is JavaScript

- JavaScript is a client side scripting language
- It is used to make web pages alive.
- It is used to programmatically perform actions within the page.
- When JavaScript was created, it was initially called "LiveScript".
- But Java was a very popular language at that time, so it was decided that positioning a language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.
